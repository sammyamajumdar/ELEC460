# ELEC460
Models developed for the Catalyst dataset will be made available in this repository as they are finished training for the ELEC 460 MSc project module.

05/07/2020: ELM implementation of the dataset uploaded. Note: There has been some issues with how Jupyter notebook renders asterisks and how github renders them, I have found some are not showing in the markdown section of the notebook. Hence, I would mention that H*, A* are pseudo inverse matrices of H and A respectively.
